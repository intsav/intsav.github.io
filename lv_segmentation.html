              <br>
              <h3> The segmentation of Left Ventricle (LV) is currently carried out manually by the experts, and the automation of this process has proved challenging due
                to the presence of speckle noise and the inherently poor quality of the ultrasound
                images. This study aims to evaluate the performance of different state-of-the-art
                Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) segmentation models to segment the LV
                endocardium in echocardiography images automatically. Those adopted methods
                include U-Net, SegNet, and fully convolutional DenseNets (FC-DenseNet). The
                prediction outputs of the models are used to assess the performance of the CNN
                models by comparing the automated results against the expert annotations (as the
                gold standard). Results reveal that the U-Net model outperforms other models by
                achieving an average Dice coefficient of 0.93 ± 0.04, and Hausdorff distance of
                4.52 ± 0.90.

              <h2>Dataset</h2>
              <h3>The study population consisted of 61 patients (30 males), with a mean age of 64 ± 11,
                who were recruited from patients who had undergone echocardiography with Imperial
                College Healthcare NHS Trust. Only patients in sinus rhythm were included. No other
                exclusion criteria were applied. The study was approved by the local ethics committee
                and written informed consent was obtained.<br>
                Each patient underwent standard Transthoracic echocardiography using a commercially available ultrasound machine (Philips iE33, Philips Healthcare, UK), and by experienced echocardiographers. Apical 4-chamber views were obtained in the left lateral
                decubitus position as per standard clinical guidelines [3].
                All recordings were obtained with a constant image resolution of 480 × 640 pixels.
                The operators performing the exam were advised to optimise the images as would typically be done in clinical practice. The acquisition period was 10 s to make sure at least
                three cardiac cycles were present in all cine loops. To take into account, the potential
                influence of the probe placement (the angle of insonation) on the measurements, the
                entire process was conducted three times, with the probe removed from the chest and
                then placed back on the chest optimally between each recording. A total of three 10-s
                2D cine loops was, therefore, acquired for each patient. The images were stored digitally
                for subsequent offline analysis.<br>
                To obtain the gold-standard (ground-truth) measurements, one accredited and experienced cardiology expert manually traced the LV borders. Where the operator judged
                a beat to be of extremely low quality, the beast was declared invalid, and no annotation was made. We developed a custom-made program which closely replicated the
                interface of echo hardware. The expert visually inspected the cine loops by controlled
                animation of the loops using arrow keys and manually traced the LV borders using a
                trackball for the end-diastolic and end-systolic frames. Three heartbeats (6 manual traces
                for end-diastolic and end-systolic frames) were measured within each cine loop. Out of
                1098 available frames (6 patients × 3 positions × 3 heartbeats × 2 ED/ES frames), a
                total of 992 frames were annotated. To investigate the inter-observer variability, a second operator repeated the LV tracing on 992 frames, blinded to the judgment of the
                first operator. A typical 2D 4-chamber view is shown in Fig. 1, where the locations of
                manually segmented endocardium by the two operators are highlighted.</h3>

                <h3> <br><P>Standard and well-established U-Net neural network architecture was firstly used
                  since this architecture is applicable to multiple medical image segmentation problems.
                  The U-Net architecture comprises of three main steps such as down-sampling, upsampling steps and cross-over connections. During the down-sampling stage, the number
                  of features will increase gradually while during up-sampling stage the original image
                  resolution will recover. Also, cross-over connection is used by concatenating equally
                  size feature maps from down-sampling to the up-sampling to recover features that may
                  be lost during the down-sampling process.<br><br>
                  Each down-sampling and up-sampling has five levels, and each level has two convolutional layers with the same number of kernels ranging from 64 to 1024 from top to bottom
                  correspondingly. All convolutions kernels have a size of (3 × 3). For down-sampling
                  Max pooling with size (2 × 2) and equal strides was used.
                  In addition to the U-net, SegNet and FC-DenseNet models were also investigated.
                  The SegNet model contains an encoder stage, a corresponding decoder stage followed
                  by a pixel-wise classification layer. In SegNet model, to accomplish non-linear upsampling, the decoder performs pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of
                  the corresponding encoder. The number of kernels and kernel size was the same as
                  the U-Net model.<br><br>
                  FC-DenseNet model is a relatively more recent model which consists of a downsampling and up-sampling path made of dense block. The down-sampling path is composed of two Transitions Down (TD) while an up-sampling path is containing two
                  Transitions Up (TU). Before and after each dense block, there is concatenation and
                  skip connections (see Fig. 2). The connectivity pattern in the up-sampling is different
                  from the down-sampling path. In the down-sampling path, the input to a dense block is
                  concatenated with its output, leading to linear growth of the number of feature maps,
                  whereas in the up-sampling path, it is not.
                  All models produce the output with the same spatial size as the input image
                  (i.e., 320 × 240).

                <h3>The Dice Coefficient (DC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and intersection-over-union (IoU)
                  also known as the Jaccard index were employed to evaluate the performance and accuracy
                  of the CNN models in segmenting the LV region. The DC  was calculated to measure
                  the overlapping regions of the Predicted segmentation (P) and the ground truth (GT).
                  The range of DC is a value between 0 and 1, which 0 indicates there is not any overlap
                  between two sets of binary segmentation results while 1, indicates complete overlap.<br><br>
                  Also, the HD was calculated using the following formula for the contour of segmentation where, d(j, GT, P) is the distance from contour point j in GT to the closest contour

                 results, while the green line represents the manual annotation.<br>

                 lower HD (4.24) score. A visual inspection of the automatically detected LV border also
                 confirms this. The LV border obtained from the SegNet and FC-DenseNet models seems
                 to be less smooth compared to that in the U-Net model. However, all three models seem

               <p> Figure 4 illustrates the results for a sample failed case, for which all three models

                 for such cases, it is evident that the image quality tends to be lower due to missing borders,presence of speckle noise or artefacts,
                 and poor contrast between the myocardium and
                 the blood pool.

                  <h2><b>Conclusion and Future Work</b></h2>
                  <h3><br><p class="text-justify">The time-consuming and operator-dependent process of manual annotation of left ventricle border on a 2D echocardiographic recording could be assisted by the automated
                        models that do not require human intervention. Our study investigated the feasibility of
                        such automated models which perform no worse than human experts.<br><br>
                        The automated models demonstrate larger discrepancies with the gold-standard
                        annotations when encountered with the lower image qualities. This is potentially caused
                        by the lack of balanced data in terms of different image quality levels. Since the patient
                        data in our study was obtained by the expert echocardiographers, the distribution leans
                        more towards higher average and higher quality images. This may result in the model
                        forming a bias towards the more condensed quality-level images. Future investigations
                        will examine the correlation between the performance of the deep learning model and
                        the image qualities, as well as using more balanced datasets.<br><br>
                        The patients were a convenience sample drawn from those attending a cardiology
                        outpatient clinic. They, therefore, may not be representative of patients who enter trials
                        with particular enrolment criteria or of inpatients or the general population. A further
                        investigation will look at a wide range of subjects in any cardiovascular disease setting.
                        The segmentation of other cardiac views, and using data acquired by various ultrasound
                        vendors can also be considered for a comprehensive examination of the deep learning
                        models in echocardiography.</h3>
