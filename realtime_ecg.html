                <b>Background:</b> <br>


                Heart disease is single biggest cause of death worldwide and the number of people affect is growing every year. Heart disease often starts with symptoms or abnormalities in very brief episodes that come and go. This early period is usually the best time to start treatment to prevent more severe problems later on. Unfortunately, this is also the most difficult time to identify the problem because the symptoms or abnormalities have gone by the time the patient sees a doctor. The doctor cannot start the correct treatment until the condition is known.
                <br>
For example, atrial fibrillation is a common heart condition that can cause strokes, which result in permanent disability. Atrial fibrillation starts off with very brief periods of rapid heartbeat that are not always noticed by the person having them. When that person sees a doctor, the heart rhythm has returned to normal so the doctor cannot diagnose the problem. There are many causes of rapid heartbeat, but only atrial fibrillation is treated with blood thinning medication to prevent strokes and save lives. In other conditions blood thinners are dangerous. In this common situation, doctors have two options but both are problematic. They can offer patients short-term heart rhythm monitoring, that stick to the skin, to try to catch an episode, but these are very uncomfortable, visible to those around them and the only record for a few days. They could instead offer patients ‘implantable’ device that last a longer time but need an operation to insert them, risking bleeding and infection and leaving a scar.


                <br><br><b>Aim:</b><br>
                Our vision is to develop smart clothing that uses artificial intelligence to identify heart disease in people in their daily lives so that the correct treatment can be provided at the earliest possible time.                
                
                <br><br><b>Objectives:</b><br>
                To achieve the overarching aim, the following specific objectives will be pursued:

                <ul>
                  
                  <ul type="square">
                    <li>Develop novel text-image fusion techniques for medical diagnosis.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the performance of text-image fusion models in enhancing interpretation compared to traditional methods.</li>
                    <li>Investigate the impact of text-image fusion on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Design and implement clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of text-image fusion in real-world settings.</li>
                  </ul>
                



<br><br><b>Candidate profile:</b><br>
                We are seeking highly motivated candidates with a strong background in computer science, machine learning, or a related field. The ideal candidate should possess solid programming skills, algorithm design expertise, and optimization techniques. While prior experience or knowledge in embedded systems and deep learning is advantageous, it is not mandatory. Strong analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and excellent communication and collaboration skills are essential for success in this PhD position.
                <br><br><b>Further information:</b><br>
                This PhD position offers a supportive research environment, access to state-of-the-art facilities, and the opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers in the field. The successful candidate will receive a competitive stipend and opportunities for conference participation and publication of research findings.
                <br><br><b>Application details:</b><br>
                To apply for this position, interested candidates should submit a detailed CV, a cover letter outlining their research interests and motivation for pursuing a PhD in Optimizing Machine Learning for Embedded Systems, and provide contact information for two academic references. Shortlisted candidates will be invited for an interview to further discuss their research ideas and suitability for the position.
                <br><br><b>Expected start date:</b> January, May, and September of each academic year.<br>
                <br><b>Duration:</b> This is a three-year position <br>
                <br>
