                <h3>
                  <b>Research context:</b> <br>
                  In recent years, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems have undergone significant advancements, and it is anticipated that UAV-based services will generate markets valued at over £600 billion by 2050. These services encompass various applications, including the delivery of goods and medical supplies, as well as the inspection and maintenance of energy infrastructure. However, in order for UAV systems to realize their full potential, they must be capable of operating safely in complex environments where challenges such as sensing and predicting external disturbances, obstacle avoidance, and maneuvering in cluttered surroundings arise. Conventional controllers limit the operational capabilities of these aircraft. Therefore, the focus of this PhD research is to overcome this limitation by integrating distributed sensing and nonlinear flight control techniques.
                  <br><br><b>Research goal:</b><br>
                  The goal of this PhD research is to evaluate the effectiveness of different flight control strategies that utilize distributed sensing to enable agile UAV maneuvers. The research will explore three innovative technologies: bio-inspired distributed sensing, machine learning-based flight control, and wind tunnel dynamic testing. By applying machine learning techniques, the research aims to develop flight controllers that can effectively utilize the information obtained from distributed sensing arrays. Additionally, algorithms will be designed and simulated to model and analyze the performance of the proposed system. Real aerodynamic conditions will be used to test and evaluate the developed flight controllers.
