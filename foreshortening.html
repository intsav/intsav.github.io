              <br>
              <h3> Foreshortening is a common challenge in acquiring high-quality apical four-chamber (A4C) echocardiographic images. It occurs when the apex of the heart is not adequately visualised, leading to inaccurate assessments of cardiac structure and function. This project aims to create a standardised, open-access dataset of A4C images with varying degrees of foreshortening, along with expert annotations.

                <h3> <br><P>Standard and well-established U-Net neural network architecture was firstly used
                  since this architecture is applicable to multiple medical image segmentation problems.
                  The U-Net architecture comprises of three main steps such as down-sampling, upsampling steps and cross-over connections. During the down-sampling stage, the number
                  of features will increase gradually while during up-sampling stage the original image
                  resolution will recover. Also, cross-over connection is used by concatenating equally
                  size feature maps from down-sampling to the up-sampling to recover features that may
                  be lost during the down-sampling process.<br><br>
                  Each down-sampling and up-sampling has five levels, and each level has two convolutional layers with the same number of kernels ranging from 64 to 1024 from top to bottom
                  correspondingly. All convolutions kernels have a size of (3 × 3). For down-sampling
                  Max pooling with size (2 × 2) and equal strides was used.
                  In addition to the U-net, SegNet and FC-DenseNet models were also investigated.
                  The SegNet model contains an encoder stage, a corresponding decoder stage followed
                  by a pixel-wise classification layer. In SegNet model, to accomplish non-linear upsampling, the decoder performs pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of
                  the corresponding encoder. The number of kernels and kernel size was the same as
                  the U-Net model.<br><br>
                  FC-DenseNet model is a relatively more recent model which consists of a downsampling and up-sampling path made of dense block. The down-sampling path is composed of two Transitions Down (TD) while an up-sampling path is containing two
                  Transitions Up (TU). Before and after each dense block, there is concatenation and
                  skip connections (see Fig. 2). The connectivity pattern in the up-sampling is different
                  from the down-sampling path. In the down-sampling path, the input to a dense block is
                  concatenated with its output, leading to linear growth of the number of feature maps,
                  whereas in the up-sampling path, it is not.
                  All models produce the output with the same spatial size as the input image
                  (i.e., 320 × 240).

                <h3>The Dice Coefficient (DC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and intersection-over-union (IoU)
                  also known as the Jaccard index were employed to evaluate the performance and accuracy
                  of the CNN models in segmenting the LV region. The DC  was calculated to measure
                  the overlapping regions of the Predicted segmentation (P) and the ground truth (GT).
                  The range of DC is a value between 0 and 1, which 0 indicates there is not any overlap
                  between two sets of binary segmentation results while 1, indicates complete overlap.<br><br>
                  Also, the HD was calculated using the following formula for the contour of segmentation where, d(j, GT, P) is the distance from contour point j in GT to the closest contour
                  point in P. The number of pixels on the contour of GT and P specified with O and M
                  respectively.<br>
                  Moreover, the IoU was calculated image-by-image between the Predicted segmentation (IP) and the ground truth (GT). For a binary image (one foreground class, one
                background class), IoU is defined for the ground truth and predicted segmentation GT

                 results, while the green line represents the manual annotation.<br>
                 <br>As can be seen, the U-Net model achieved higher DC (0.98), higher IoU (0.99), and
                 lower HD (4.24) score. A visual inspection of the automatically detected LV border also
                 confirms this. The LV border obtained from the SegNet and FC-DenseNet models seems
                 to be less smooth compared to that in the U-Net model. However, all three models seem
                 to perform with reasonable accuracy.<br> <br><br><br>
               <p> Figure 4 illustrates the results for a sample failed case, for which all three models
                 seem to struggle with the task of LV segmentation. By closer scrutiny of the echo images
                 for such cases, it is evident that the image quality tends to be lower due to missing borders,presence of speckle noise or artefacts,
                 and poor contrast between the myocardium and
                 the blood pool.

                  <h3><br><p class="text-justify">The time-consuming and operator-dependent process of manual annotation of left ventricle border on a 2D echocardiographic recording could be assisted by the automated
                        models that do not require human intervention. Our study investigated the feasibility of
                        such automated models which perform no worse than human experts.<br><br>
                        The automated models demonstrate larger discrepancies with the gold-standard
                        annotations when encountered with the lower image qualities. This is potentially caused
                        by the lack of balanced data in terms of different image quality levels. Since the patient
                        data in our study was obtained by the expert echocardiographers, the distribution leans
                        more towards higher average and higher quality images. This may result in the model
                        forming a bias towards the more condensed quality-level images. Future investigations
                        will examine the correlation between the performance of the deep learning model and
                        the image qualities, as well as using more balanced datasets.<br><br>
                        The patients were a convenience sample drawn from those attending a cardiology
                        outpatient clinic. They, therefore, may not be representative of patients who enter trials
