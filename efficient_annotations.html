              <br>
              <h3> This project addresses the challenge of scarce annotations; using deep learning and active learning (AL) techniques to reduce annotation costs and efforts while maintaining high segmentation accuracy and improving clinical workflow efficiency.
              </h3>
              <h3> This work presents several AL methods, contributing to the cost-effective medical image annotation. The first project comprehensively evaluates existing AL approaches, establishing a valuable baseline for comparing different strategies. The second project explores ensemble-based AL techniques, leveraging different loss functions and uncertainty scoring methods. In the third project, a novel semi-supervised active learning method is developed, combining pseudo-labels from model predictions with expert annotations. The final project introduces an optimised clustering method using Fuzzy C-means for diversity sampling. </h3>
              <h3> The outcome of the AL study was utilised to create a biobank of echo images for several projects to rank images and videos based on diversity. This method ensures that clinicians focus on labelling the images that will most effectively improve the AI model's performance, reducing the overall number of images that need to be annotated.</h3>

              <h3>Three different datasets of cardiac imaging are used for our experiments:
                the CAMUS dataset, the Unity dataset, and the consensus testing dataset.<br><br>
                <b>CAMUS dataset</b> is a public, fully annotated dataset for 2D echocardiographic assessment.
                  All the details of the CAMUS dataset are available on the official website (https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/camus/index.html).


                <br><br>
                <b>Unity dataset</b>is a private dataset extracted from 1224 videos of the apical four-chamber echocardiographic view retrieved
                from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust's echocardiogram database.
                The images are obtained using ultrasound equipment from GE and Philips manufacturers.
                The acquisition of these images is ethically approved by the Health Regulatory Agency
                (Integrated Research Application System identifier 243023).<br><br>
                It contains 2800 images sampled from different points in the cardiac cycle and labelled by a pool of
                experts using our in-house online labelling platform (https://unityimaging.net).
                This dataset was used for model developments (i.e., training and validation) and split into 70% for training, 15% for validation and 15% for testing.
                <br><br>

                <b>Consensus dataset:</b> It was utilised for the testing and was curated from a series of investigations conducted over three working days in 2019, years away from the development dataset. The testing dataset consisted of 100 A4C videos, from which 200 end-diastolic and end-systolic frames were selected automatically using a previously developed model. 11 human experts labelled each image using the same platform, mutually blinded to the labels of the others. The average of these 11 annotations was used for each image to create its GT. This provided high-quality consensus reference annotations, which served as a uniquely robust and representative benchmark for performance evaluations.

                    Unity and CAMUS datasets were used in this study for model development and testing.
                    <br><br> A pool-based AL methodology is applied throughout, encompassing four steps: training the U-Net model on the initial annotated data (L), calculating the model uncertainty scores or representativeness scores on the unlabelled pool of data (U), selecting the top-ranked batch of images (K) to obtain their labels from oracle and add them to L and remove them from U, and finally retrain the model on the updated L. These steps are repeated until the optimal number of AL iterations is reached.
                  <br><br>
                    Random sampling and a variety of different selective sampling approaches are used for selecting the next batch of images from the unlabelled pool. The most common AL selection strategy is uncertainty sampling, where the most uncertain unlabelled images are queried for annotation. Such uncertainty methods include: Pixel-wise, Max_Entropy, and MCD ensemble-based methods using MCD_Eentropy, variance (MCD_Var), and Bayesian active learning with disagreement (BALD).

                Our experiments show that the Max_Entropy is the best uncertainty strategy compared to others on CAMUS and Unity datasets. It achieved 97.7% of the entire dataset performance on CAMUS using 25% of the annotated dataset. At the same time, the other methods required approximately 35% to approach similar performance. Thus, it reduced the annotation cost by 10% to get that performance.

                    In this study, the Unity data set was used for model development, while the Consensus dataset was used for model testing. 
                    <br><br> The SSAL method selects reliable pseudo-labels from the mid-range of uncertainty scores in the unlabelled pool, representing the majority of samples, alongside expert labels of uncertain images to optimise annotation. A validation step is applied to choose the most confident pseudo-labels. 
                  <br><br>
                    The phases of our method are as follows:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                      <li> The U-Net model is initially trained on the initial labelled data. At each AL iteration, uncertainty scores are computed for every image in the unlabelled pool using the model’s prediction. Then, images are ranked based on these scores, and the most uncertain samples are queried for annotation. </li>
                      <li> Uncertainty scores for remaining unlabelled samples are normalised; The highest frequency bin in the uncertainty histogram determines the range of images as candidate pseudo labels. </li>
                      <li> A threshold-shifting is applied to validate candidate pseudo-label quality. We analysed masks created at 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 thresholds, focusing on variance. Low variance indicates strong model confidence, signifying stable segmentation across threshold adjustments. Reliable pseudo-labels are chosen from the low variance of the predictions, with post-processing applied before training.</li>
                      <li> The final batch including expert annotations for uncertain images and reliable pseudo-labels is transferred from the unlabelled set to the labelled set, and the model is fine-tuned with the updated labelled data. These steps are iterated until AL iterations are met.</li>
                    </ul>

The proposed method was compared against the benchmark Greedy K-Center and random sampling methods to evaluate its effectiveness. Additionally, different feature extraction methods were applied, and PCA was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted features, facilitating efficient clustering and similarity measurement. This introduced methodology aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of AL in the high-dimensional context of LV segmentation in echocardiography.</h3>

                <br>
                Integrating AL with Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning by developing methodologies to utilise unlabelled data during the AL process under very few label regimes is a promising research direction. Additionally, verification techniques should be developed to ensure the quality of pseudo-labels in SSAL frameworks.
                <br>
                Handling the noisy labels by applying effective techniques to tackle the noisy labels and integrating these algorithms with AL for a more robust model with fewer and high-quality annotations.
