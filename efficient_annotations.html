              <br>
              <h3> The training of advanced deep learning algorithms for medical image interpretation requires precisely
                annotated datasets, which is laborious and expensive. Therefore, this research investigates state-of-the-art
                active learning methods for utilising limited annotations when performing automated left ventricle
                segmentation in echocardiography. Our experiments reveal that the performance of different sampling strategies varies between datasets from the same domain. Further, an optimised method for representativeness sampling is introduced, combining images from feature-based outliers to the most representative samples for label acquisition. The proposed method significantly outperforms the current literature and demonstrates convergence with minimal annotations. We demonstrate that careful
                selection of images can reduce the number of images needed to be annotated by up to 70%. This research can
                therefore present a cost-effective approach to handling datasets with limited expert annotations in
                echocardiography.

              <h3>Two different datasets of cardiac imaging are used for our experiments:
                the CAMUS dataset and the Unity dataset.<br><br>
                <b>CAMUS dataset</b> is a public, fully annotated dataset for 2D echocardiographic assessment that
                contains 500 images from 2D apical four-champers and two-champers view sequences. <br>
                All the details of the CAMUS dataset are available on the official website (https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/camus/index.html).
                We split CAMUS dataset into 70% (350 images) for training, 15% (50 images for validation), and 15% (50 images) for testing.

                <br><br>
                <b>Unity dataset</b>is a private dataset extracted from 1224 videos of the apical four-chamber echocardiographic view retrieved
                from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust's echocardiogram database.
                The images are obtained using ultrasound equipment from GE and Philips manufacturers.
                The acquisition of these images is ethically approved by the Health Regulatory Agency
                (Integrated Research Application System identifier 243023).<br><br>
                It contains 2800 images sampled from different points in the cardiac cycle and labelled by a pool of
                experts using our in-house online labelling platform (https://unityimaging.net).
                This dataset was used for model developments (i.e., training and validation) and split into 70% for training, 15% for validation and 15% for testing.

                <h2>Implementation</h2>
                <h3>A standard Active Learning (AL) methodology is applied throughout,  encompassing four steps: training the
                  U-Net model on the initial annotated data (L),
                  calculating the model uncertainty scores or representativeness scores on the unlabeled pool of data (U),
                  selecting the top-ranked batch of images (K) to obtain their labels from oracle and add them to L and remove
                   them from U, and finally retrain the model on the updated L.
                   These steps are repeated until the optimal number of AL iterations is reached. <br>
                   Random sampling and a variety of different selective sampling approaches are used for
                   selecting the next batch of images from the unlabelled pool.
                   The most common AL selection strategy is uncertainty sampling, where the most uncertain unlabelled images are
                   quiried for annotation. Such uncertainty methods include: Classification Uncertainty (Pixel-wise), Predictive entropy,
                   and Monte Carlo droupout ensemble-based methods using entropy, variance (Var), variation ratio (Var_ratio),
                   standard diviation (STD), Coeffcient of variation (Coef_var),
                   and Bayesian active learning with disagreement (BALD).<br><br>
                   <b> Training settings: </b> Tensorflow and Keras frameworks are used for the development of DL models, and training was conducted using an Nvidia RTX3090 GPU. U-Net was trained using binary cross-entropy loss and ADAM optimiser with a learning rate of 0.0001 for 200 epochs. Images were resized to 512x512, and a fixed batch size of 8 was applied.
                  For small datasets A and B, we selected 10% of the initial training data as L, and U will be the remaining 90%.
                  For the larger dataset, we chose 4% as the initial L, and the remaining is for the U, which will be
                  used as an oracle. Finally, to have a fair comparison between methods, we trained the model on the
                  initially labelled data of
                  the three datasets and used the same model's weights for training the following AL iterations.</h3>

              <h3>Fig. 3 shows the performance of uncertainty sampling techniques compared to random selection on CAMUS and Unity datasets.
                The horizontal black dashed line presents the performance of the entire labelled dataset. Our experiments show that the predictive Entropy is the best uncertainty strategy compared
                to others on CAMUS and Unity datasets (see Fig. 3). For example, the predictive Entropy achieved 97.7% of the
                entire dataset performance on CAMUS using 25% of the annotated dataset. At the same time,
                the other policies ( BALD, Var, Var-ratio, Coef-var, STD, pixel-wise) required approximately
                35% to approach that performance. Thus, it reduced the annotation cost by 10% to get
                that performance. Moreover, it kept converging to the maximum performance achieving 98%
                and 99% of the whole dataset performance using 35% and 40% of labels, respectively. <br>
              Coef-Var achieved 98% of the entire dataset performance on the CAMUS dataset using 40%
              of the annotations, outperforming random,pixel-wise and MDC-Entropy methods and almost
              performing similarly to other methods. After using 60% of the labels, Predictive Entropy,
              Coef-Var, Var-ratio, and BALD converged to the maximum performance outperforming other
              selection policies.
              For the Unity dataset, the predictive Entropy significantly outperformed all the other
              methods from the early stages of AL achieving 98.3% and ~ 99% of the entire dataset performance
              using only 7% and 20%  of the labels, respectively. At the same time, Coef-Var, pixel-wise, Var-ratio,
              Var and BALD needed 15% of the annotation to get 98% of the maximum performance. After using 27% of
              the annotations. Pixel-wise almost converged to the ultimate performance outperforming all other
              uncertainty techniques.  <br><br>
              Out experiments shows that most MCD ensemble methods usually do not converge till the end, such as
              Var, BALD and Var-ratio. However, some of them perform well at the early AL stages. In addition,
              our investigations show that our newly added method, Coef-Var, can perform well for some datasets.
              Thus, we recommend adding it to the heuristic uncertainty selection strategies when using ensemble techniques.  <br>
              Our experiments demonstrate the performance of various uncertainty sampling strategies varies
              amongst different datasets from the same domain.
