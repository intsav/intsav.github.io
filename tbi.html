                      <b>Background:</b> <br>


                      Heart disease is single biggest cause of death worldwide and the number of people affect is
                      growing every year. Heart disease often starts with symptoms or abnormalities in very brief
                      episodes that come and go. This early period is usually the best time to start treatment to
                      prevent more severe problems later on. Unfortunately, this is also the most difficult time to
                      identify the problem because the symptoms or abnormalities have gone by the time the patient sees
                      a doctor. The doctor cannot start the correct treatment until the condition is known.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      For example, atrial fibrillation is a common heart condition that can cause strokes, which result
                      in permanent disability. Atrial fibrillation starts off with very brief periods of rapid heartbeat
                      that are not always noticed by the person having them. When that person sees a doctor, the heart
                      rhythm has returned to normal so the doctor cannot diagnose the problem. There are many causes of
                      rapid heartbeat, but only atrial fibrillation is treated with blood thinning medication to prevent
                      strokes and save lives. In other conditions blood thinners are dangerous. In this common
                      situation, doctors have two options but both are problematic. They can offer patients short-term
                      heart rhythm monitoring, that stick to the skin, to try to catch an episode, but these are very
                      uncomfortable, visible to those around them and the only record for a few days. They could instead
                      offer patients ‘implantable’ device that last a longer time but need an operation to insert them,
                      risking bleeding and infection and leaving a scar.


                      <br><br><b>Aim:</b><br>
                      Our vision is to develop smart clothing that uses artificial intelligence to identify heart
                      disease in people in their daily lives so that the correct treatment can be provided at the
                      earliest possible time.

                      <br><br><b>Plan:</b><br>
                      We are developing intelligent clothing that can be worn by people comfortably in their everyday
                      lives without anyone around them noticing and without any risky procedures. The clothes have
                      sensors to pick up abnormalities and use artificial intelligence to identify heart problems using
                      these sensors. These clothes can be worn during almost every activity when symptoms or
                      abnormalities might occur, including work, exercise and sleep. They can be worn for long periods
                      of time to catch rare symptoms. We have several heart specialists on our team: their patients
                      regularly report that they would prefer comfortable, discreet clothing to bulky, visible
                      short-term monitors or implanted devices.





                      <br><br><b>Candidate profile:</b><br>
                      We are seeking highly motivated candidates with a strong background in computer science, machine
                      learning, or a related field. The ideal candidate should possess solid programming skills. Strong
                      analytical skills,
                      problem-solving abilities, and excellent communication and collaboration skills are essential for
                      success in this PhD position.
                      <br><br><b>Further information:</b><br>
                      This PhD position offers a supportive research environment, access to state-of-the-art facilities,
                      and the opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers in the field. The successful candidate
                      will receive a competitive stipend and opportunities for conference participation and publication
                      of research findings.
                      <br><br><b>Application details:</b><br>
                      To apply for this position, interested candidates should submit a detailed CV, a cover letter
                      outlining their research interests and motivation for pursuing a PhD.
                      Shortlisted candidates will be invited for an interview to further discuss their research ideas
                      and suitability for the position.
                      <br><br><b>Expected start date:</b> January, May, and September of each academic year.<br>
                      <br><b>Duration:</b> This is a three-year position <br>
                      <br>
