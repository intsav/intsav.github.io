                 Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is a condition where the normal lining of the esophagus is replaced by
                 abnormal tissue, increasing the risk of esophageal cancer. <br>The early detection of BE is crucial
                  for timely treatment and improved patient outcomes. However, the current method of diagnosing
                  BE is through endoscopy, which is an invasive and time-consuming procedure.
                  <br>Moreover, the visual assessment of endoscopic images for BE detection is
                  subjective and prone to inter-observer variability.

                 <br><br>To overcome these limitations, there is a need for an automated system that can detect BE in
                 endoscopic images accurately and efficiently. The aim of this project is to develop an
                 automated early detection system for BE in endoscopic images using machine learning algorithms.<br><br>
                 The project will involve the following steps:<br><br>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Data Preprocessing to remove noise and artifacts, and to enhance the contrast and sharpness of the images.
                     This step will improve the quality of the images and ensure better detection accuracy.

                   </li>
                   <li>Develop a deep learning Model for automatic classification of the endoscopic images as BE or non-BE.
                   </li>
                   <li>Evaluation the performance of the developed model on test set of endoscopic images using evaluation metrics.

                   Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, with about 1.8 million new
                   cases and 900,000 deaths per year. Screening for colorectal cancer is essential for early
                   detection and prevention, and colonoscopy is the most effective screening method. However, the
                   effectiveness of colonoscopy depends on the ability of the endoscopist to detect and remove polyps,
                   which are the precursor lesions to colorectal cancer.
                   Missed polyps can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, and therefore,
                   improving polyp detection rates is crucial for reducing the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer.
